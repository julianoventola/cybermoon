## Color Problem üëª

Every color is used more than once generally for the same purpose, this makes it very difficult to update a color that looks great in HTML, without it becoming tiring in Javascript.

If you want to contribute/suggest a color change, I recommend looking inside the "themes" folder, inside the JSON file, to see that in 1200 lines the same color is used for different languages.

I tested the colors with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Dockerfile, Json and Markdown, so several languages are missing. I ask that you test combinations before suggesting changes.

Thank you for your attention üòÅ
